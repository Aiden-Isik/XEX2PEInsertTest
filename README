XEX2 PE Insertion Test

Copyright (c) 2024 Aiden Isik

This is a test program made during the planning of the FreeChainXenon
project, a fully free/libre homebrew toolchain for the Xbox 360. It
takes an Xbox 360 PE basefile file path as parameter 1 and an output file
path as parameter 2 and inserts the PE file along with some descriptor
info into the output file.

The program does not check for file validity and has no actual checks for
failures. It is expected you give it a valid PE basefile.

Prerequisites:
 - GCC (on Debian: sudo apt install build-essential)

To compile: gcc main.c -o xex2peinserttest

Usage: ./xex2peinserttest <pe basefile> <output file>
